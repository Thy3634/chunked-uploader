<!-- /automd -->

Import:

<!-- automd:jsimport cjs cdn imports="ChunkedUploader" -->

**ESM** (Node.js, Bun)

```js
import { ChunkedUploader } from "@thy3634/chunked-uploader";
```

**CommonJS** (Legacy Node.js)

```js
const { ChunkedUploader } = require("@thy3634/chunked-uploader");
```

**CDN** (Deno, Bun and Browsers)

```js
import { ChunkedUploader } from "https://esm.sh/@thy3634/chunked-uploader";
```

<!-- /automd -->

1. Create a new instance of `ChunkedUploader`:

```js
// usually you need to get a upload ID from server
const { id } = await ofetch(getURL('/chunked-upload'), {
    method: 'POST',
    body: {
        fileSize: file.size,
        filename: file.name
    }
})
// create a new instance of ChunkedUploader
const uploader = new ChunkedUploader(file, ({ index }) => getURL(joinURL('chunked-upload', id, index.toString())))
```

2. Listen to events:

```js
uploader.on('progress', ({ loaded, total }) => {
    console.log(`progress: ${loaded}/${total}`)
})
uploader.on('error', (event) => {
    console.error(uploader.error)
})
uploader.on('success', (event) => {
    console.log('success')
})
```

3. Start uploading:

```js
uploader.start()
// or await for completion, which will return the response list, or throw error
await uploader.start()
```

## API

### Class `ChunkedUploader`

> Extends [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget)

#### Constructor

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file | [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/File) \| `FileInfo & { chunks: Chunk[] }` | The file to upload, or an object containing the file's information and an array of chunks |
| requestInfo | [`RequestInfo`](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch#resource) \| `(chunk: Chunk, fileInfo: FileInfo) => RequestInfo` | Request information, or a function that returns request information based on the chunk and file information |
| requestOptions | [`RequestOptions`](#requestoptions) | Based on the FetchOptions type from the ofetch library, with some additional properties. |

#### Methods and Properties

##### `start(): Promise<Response[]>`
Start the upload, if the upload is already started, do nothing, otherwise:
- property `status` will be set to 'pending'
- event `start` will be dispatched
- if `onLine` is false, pause
###### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skipIndexes | `number[]` | indexes of chunks to skip

##### `pause(): boolean`
Pause the upload, if it is not uploading, do nothing, otherwise:
- property `status` will be set to 'paused'
- method `abort` will be called
- event `pause` will be dispatched

##### `resume(): Promise<Response[]> | false`
Resume the upload, if it is not paused, do nothing, otherwise:
- property `status` will be set to 'pending'
- event `resume` will be dispatched

##### `store(): FileInfo & { chunks: Chunk[] }`
Get the file information and chunks so that you can store them and reconstruct the uploader later.

##### `status: 'idle' \| 'pending' \| 'paused' \| 'error' \| 'success'`
The current status of the upload process. read-only.

##### `error: Error | undefined`
The error that occurred during the upload.

##### `total: number`
The total number of chunks. read-only.

##### `loaded: number`
The number of chunks that have been uploaded. read-only.

##### `hash: string`
A promise that resolves to the MD5 hash (hex) of the file's data. read-only.

##### `chunks: Chunk[]`
The chunks array. read-only.

##### `onLine: boolean`
Is network online. If `navigator` is available, use the value of `navigator.onLine` as the default value, otherwise `true`.
- When it is set to `false`, the upload will be paused. When it is set to `true`, the upload will be resumed. 
- If `window` is available, automatically update, and pause/resume the upload.

##### `abort(): boolean`
Abort the upload, if it is not uploading, do nothing, otherwise:
- property `status` will be set to 'error'
- event 'abort' will be dispatched

#### Events

- `start`: dispatched when the upload has started.
- `progress`: dispatched periodically as any chunk uploaded.
- `pause`: dispatched when the upload pauses.
- `resume`: dispatched when the upload resumes.
- `error`: dispatched when an error occurs during the upload.
- `success`: dispatched when the upload completes successfully.
- `end`: dispatched when the upload has completed, successfully or not.

```js
// you can listen to these events using the `on${EventType}` method:
uploader.onsuccess = (event) => {
    console.log('success')
}
// or using the `addEventListener` method:
uploader.addEventListener('success', (event) => {
    console.log('success')
})
```
